        To anybody confused about why he expands the bounds by `skinWidth * -2` :

        The Bounds class represents an Axis Aligned Bounding Box (AABB), which only has a center point position, and the extents for each axis. 

        So if you had a AABB at the center of the world, each side having a length of 1 unit, it would look like:
        Position: (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
        Extents:  (0.5, 0.5, 0.5)

        As you can see, the extents are half of the total box length on one axis.
        When you call `Bounds.Expand(amount)` you are actually expanding each extent by `amount/2`,
        so to actually expand by the amount you want on both (positive and negative) sides of the axis, you have to multiply by 2.
        You can then negate the value to contract the bounding box instead of expanding it.
